## Footer

```html
<html lang="en" class="h-100" data-bs-theme="dark">
```

Requires `class="h-100"`

```html
<body class="d-flex flex-column h-100">
```

The above.

## Dark/light mode

Is not perfect, works best with non-custom classes. For instance, check out the code in `switchElement.addEventListener` for what is needed for the footer colors.

[:lang()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:lang)

The `:lang()` CSS [pseudo-class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) matches elements based on the language they are determined to be in.


In HTML5 you can actually define `lang` for each element. That means if you have a div that contains Mandarin Chinese in it, just define an attribute `lang="zh-CN"` for that div, like `<div lang="zh-CN">`.

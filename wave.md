# WAVE Browser Extensions

The WAVE `Chrome`, `Firefox`, and `Edge` extensions allows you to evaluate web content for accessibility issues **directly within your browser**. Because the extension runs entirely within your web browser, no information is sent to the WAVE server. This ensures 100% private and secure accessibility reporting. The extension can check intranet, password-protected, dynamically generated, or sensitive web pages. Also, because the WAVE extension evaluates the rendered version of your page, locally displayed styles and dynamically-generated content from scripts or AJAX can be evaluated.

> [!TIP]
> When creating new web pages or modifying existing pages, use this tool to validate the user interface sooner rather than later as it's easier to fix issues early in the development process.

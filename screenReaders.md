# Screen Reader Testing

Screen readers are a specialist text-to-speech software that can be used by people with little to no vision to access website content, generally on a computer or mobile device. They are designed to run on the most popular operating systems, like Windows, iOS and Android. The content they can decipher includes emails, web pages and other documents.

This is typically achieved by the screen reader ‘announcing’ the site’s content (headings, text, links, images and so on) in an artificial voice – also known as a speech synthesizer – via the user’s device’s sound card. Some screen reader technologies also allow their users to access web content via a refreshable braille display, which is particularly useful for deaf-blind people. 

## How do visually impaired users experience websites? 

Screen reader users will experience your content differently to users who don’t rely on assistive technology. Here are some of the key differences between how a sighted user and someone using a screen reader perceives your content.

`Keyboard navigation`: Users with sight loss often rely on keyboard navigation rather than the standard combination of visual cues and a mouse to access web content. Not providing keyboard access on your website presents a major roadblock for them.

`Scanning and skipping`: It’s common for a screen reader user to use keyboard commands to skip between different sections of a web page, rather than listening to the entirety of a page being read out. That means jumping between sections quickly so they can locate the information that is most pertinent to them. They can only do this effectively if a website has been designed with screen reader usage in mind, such as using proper HTML formatting.

`Images`: As users with vision loss might struggle to accurately discern an image, they generally rely on accurate and descriptive alternative text to understand their meaning. Missing or improper alternative text poses an obstacle to their comprehension.

`Design`: While sighted users tend to use visual design cues to understand and navigate your content, screen reader users perceive your content in a linear, text-based fashion. Design elements like color and positioning, for example, carousels and pop-ups, hold less meaning for them and can even be distracting when using a screen reader.

`Links`: Many screen reader users <kbd>TAB</kbd>  from link to link to find content quickly on a page. This is much easier for them when the links are descriptive, rather than using ambiguous link anchor text like ‘click here’ and ‘learn more’.

## Is screen reader testing a requirement for WCAG compliance? 

While screen reader testing isn’t explicitly mandated for [WCAG compliance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/), it’s accessibility best practice to incorporate manual screen reader checks into website maintenance processes.

## Advance

Using a screen reader is very different than using a monitor and mouse. While testing with a screen reader, NEVER use a mouse, and rely ONLY on what you can hear (i.e., do not look at the screen to fill in gaps in what you're hearing).

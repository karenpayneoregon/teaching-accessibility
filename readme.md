| Project  | Description |

## Bootstrap

Bootstrap 5 is used, not Bootstrap 4.

The reasons, version 5 provides better accessibility features. This means if OED adapted version 5 there will be breaking changes. 

For instance, margin start for version 4 is `ml` while version 5 is `ms`.

## jQuery

No jQuery is used, only JavaScript.

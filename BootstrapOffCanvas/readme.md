# About

Simple example of Bootstrap [Offcanvas](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/offcanvas/#how-it-works).

This example toggle an off canvas on the right side of the screen.

If needed body scrolling is an option.

When backdrop is set to static, the offcanvas will not close when clicking outside of it. In this code sample the background is static.

## Responsive offcanvas classes are available across for each breakpoint.

- .offcanvas
- .offcanvas-sm
- .offcanvas-md
- .offcanvas-lg
- .offcanvas-xl
- .offcanvas-xxl

## Accessibility

Since the offcanvas panel is conceptually a modal dialog, be sure to add aria-`labelledby="..."`—referencing the offcanvas title—to `.offcanvas`. Note that you don’t need to add `role="dialog"` since we already add it via JavaScript.
